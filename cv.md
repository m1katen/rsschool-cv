## About myself
I was born in 2001, I am a student of Webster University in Tashkent (1st US University in Central Asia), major- Management Information Systems and I want to learn to code. I always dreamed of creating something significant, to be useful to the world and I think that IT is a good foundation for something bigger. 

My three main qualities as a person: communicative skills, critical thinking and fast-learning. After school I runned a business with my friend, that was textile manufacturing. We worked together for around 6 month, but after we decided to break up our relationship as partners and I went into the restaurant business, I was a cassier, selling fast-food (around 8 month). Learned stocks,shares and crypto-markets. 

Then I decided that I want to refresh my life,I learned English and pass exams into university and now, I am here.
